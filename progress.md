# Loop Engineering State & Memory

This file serves as the persistent state memory for the automated loop. The agent updates this file between turns to track what tasks have been triaged, what worktrees are active, and verification statuses.

## 📥 Triage Inbox & Backlog
These items are discovered by the automated triage schedule. They must be validated before execution.

## 🌿 Active Worktrees
To prevent collisions, parallel work occurs in isolated git worktrees.

| Worktree Path | Branch | Target Task | Created | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `C:/Users/strmshdw/.gemini/antigravity-ide/scratch/worktrees/task-012` | `feature/cache-busting` | `TASK-012` | 2026-06-26 | `Active` |

##  Verification Board
No code is merged without passing the verification loop (maker/checker split).

| Task ID | Verifier Agent | Test Commands | Results | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TASK-001` | System Verifier | `git status` | `Passed (clean)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-002` | System Verifier | Browser Subagent | `Passed (aspect ratio & rounded corners perfect)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-003` | User | Manual Verification | `Passed (manually verified by user)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-004` | System Verifier | Browser Subagent | `Passed (horizontal field layout and player tracking correct)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-005` | System Verifier | Browser Subagent | `Passed (player markers and names render in blue/orange)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-006` | System Verifier | Browser Subagent | `Passed (exact 34 boost pads parsed from res/boostpads.json match layout)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-007` | System Verifier | `powershell -File scripts/run-server.ps1` | `Passed (starts server and opens browser; clean exit)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-008` | User | Manual Verification | `Passed (manually verified by user)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-009` | User | Manual Verification | `Passed (manually verified by user)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-010` | User | Manual Verification | `Passed (manually verified by user)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-011` | User | Manual Verification | `Passed (manually verified by user)` | `Verified` |
| `TASK-012` | System Verifier | Manual Verify | Pending | Pending |
